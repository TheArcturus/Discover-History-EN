<h1>England in 1066</h1>

<br>
<h2>Crisis of succession to the throne</h2>

</br>


<p>The year 1066 is a year of passage of Halley's comet, harbinger of the crisis incoming?
Indeed, it's also a pivotal year in the history of England because a succession crisis to the throne takes place.
<br>
When King Edward the Confessor died in January 1066, leaving no children, several claimants vied for the throne of England.
Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex, supported by English nobility (the Witenagemot or witan), is crowned King of England.
<br>
On the other side of the Channel, the Duke of Normandy William the Conqueror (Guillaume in French), claims that Edward had chosen him as his successor
during his years spent in exile in Normandy.
In Norway, King Harald Hardrada uses an agreement between his predecessor (Magnus The Good) and Edward's predecessor (Hardeknut, King of Denmark and England)
under which England and Norway will go to the other if one of them should die without an heir.
<h2>Invasions</h2>
<p>In September 1066, a Scandinavian army led by Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, landed in England and won a
victory at Stamford Bridge against the forces of Harold Godwinson.
However, Harold succeeded in repelling the Vikings at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on September 25.
<br>
<br>
Shortly after, on October 14, 1066, William landed in England at the head of a large fleet made up of an army of Normans,
Bretons and French.
He won the famous Battle of Hastings against Harold Godwinson, who was then killed on the battlefield.
William the Conqueror was therefore crowned King of England on December 25, 1066, thus becoming the first Norman king of these lands.
This battle, which lasted all day on October 14, is the origin of the famous Bayeux Tapestry.
<br>

<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
To conclude, the consequences of these events are long-lasting and had a significant impact on the history of England.
The Norman invasion led to a profound transformation of English society, with the introduction of the Norman language and culture
, as well as changes in social and political structures.
It is also from this year that we can date the modern history of England.
William also sent a lot of men to record the properties of English citizens, to introduce taxes. This record is the <em>Domesday Book</em> (ended in 1086),
and is allowing us to better understand the state of England at this time.

    <p> King William I mounted, with sword and shield, accompanied by knights and soldiers. The arms of England appear
        on his surcoat, shield, and the trappings on his horse Â© The British Library Board, Cotton Claudius D. II

<h2>To go farther</h2>
<p>
What about other countries of the United Kingdom ?
<br>
Well they were all independent at that time. Scotland and Wales were separate kingdoms and Ireland was divided between
several little Celtic kingdoms. 
Vikings controlled some parts of them, which led to some conflicts.
