    <h2>The history about the settlement </h2>
    <p>
The land has been discovered eighteen years before by the well-known captain James Cook, but it is in
1788 that the first Britain fleet was sent to this new land, called in the past New Holland, and so in order
to create a penal colony (a place to send British prisoners) in Betany Bay .
All the boat arrived between the 18th and the 20th of the same month, and the settlement has been officially established when
all of them  sailed in Sydney Cove, a city they named after the Home Secretary Thomas Townshend.

    <h2>Quote</h2>
<p>
    "On 18 January 1788, the fleet, led by Arthur Phillip, arrived at Botany Bay, but the swampy land did not live up to the expectations raised by Cook's descriptions from his first voyage and it was decided to venture further into Port Jackson to find a suitable anchorage."
