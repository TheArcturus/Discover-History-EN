    <h1>Spain in 722 </h1>
    <h2>The Reconquista </h2>

    <p>The winning back of Spain which is called « La Reconquista » in spanish took place in the eighteenth
    century it began in 722  and  ended in January 1492 
    
        
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Spain before the Reconquista </h2>
    <p>
        Spain was Saracen in the Middle Ages which means that she was invaded by North Africans’ inhabitants
        whose goals were to gain territories on  the one hand  and to perhaps convert
        spanish people who were christian to Islam on the other hand.
        Saracen has been occupying  a great part of Spain (which is named Andalusia )
        when christians monarch decided to get it back .

    <h2>Seven centuries of battles </h2>
    <p>

        We can count a lot of battles like Covadonga or Cantabrique
        The last battle which took place in Grenada allowed christian to get back their territories.
        Even if the muslim empire was defeated their influence is still present :their architecture,art, traditions .. 
        for instance we can find a lot of mosque (where muslim used to pray their God) one of the most famous is located in Cordoue.
        Spain is now, like many countries in Europe, a blend of two heritages.

    Quote
    </h2>
    <p>
        "There had never truly been any doubt in Rodrigo’s mind about the outcome of battle, 
        for when he saw Jimena pale with fear upon hearing the Almoravide drums for the first time, 
        he told her that in two weeks he would lay them at her feet, 
        and then make them a votive offering to the Blessed Virgin Mary."
        extracted from El Cid, God’s Own Champion
