    <h1>Scotland in 1320</h1>
    <h2>The Declaration of Arbroath </h2>





    <p>This letter represents the symbol of independence of Scotland.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>The excommunication of the lawful sovereign </h2>

    <p>
    After the War in 1317 against England, the Pope excommunicated the King of Scotland Robert the Bruce for disobeying to his order of not triggering a war with the Kingdom of England, even though they were attacked by them.
    Due to this excommunication, the Pope and all countries in Europe considered the King of England Edward I as the legitimate King of Scotland and thus,
    Scotland as a nation that belonged to their domination.
   </p>

   <br>
    <h2>The aim of the letter </h2>
    <p>
    This letter is a part of a group of three letters sent to the Pope John XVII.
    It has been written by the Chancellor of Scotland and ratified by 51 scottish barons and aimed at assuring the Scottish sovereignty
    and independence from the Kingdom of England.
    Thanks to this letter the King excommunicated, Robert the Bruce, gained his royal title back and Scotland gained beyond its sovereignty, the right to defend its people against the invasion of English people.
    It was the first time that an entire population stood for a King that was out of the Pope's favor.

<p>
    "As long as but a hundred of us remain alive, never will we on any conditions be brought under English rule. It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours, that we are fighting, but for freedom - for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself"
